I wanted to create a custom site where I could have my developer portfolio. I wanted to be able to edit it easily and 
not be constrained to the predefined configuration of the template. That is why I decided to try to fork some cool ones 
that are already available on GitHub and that are prepared for customization. 

I found [this one](https://github.com/saadpasta/developerFolio), which looks amazing, but I found it broken, and it was 
hard for me to deploy it. That is why I put this project in hold. 

Months passed, and due to new professional projects, I had to do a blog for a documentation of a project. That is how I
discovered [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and its wonderful theme [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.com/).

It is so easy to build documentations: You just need to fork this repository, configure all parameters and add some 
content to be published. Also, you do not need to worry about infrastructure because GitHub automatically takes care of
it for you. 

All in all, there are a lot of advantages when using this method to build documentations. Disadvantages may be that 
eventually I may be in need of a stronger way of storing entities and their relations among the entities on the blog 
since I do not have a database.
